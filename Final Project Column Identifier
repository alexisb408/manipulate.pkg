For my final project, I will be using the surveys dataset. 
The surveys dataset contains 9 columns: record_id, month, day, year, plot_id, species_id, sex, hindfoot_length, and weight.

The record_id is a number assigned to a record in a database that helps the scientist or viewers identify it. 
The month is the month in which the corresponding data was recorded.
The day is the day of the month in which the corresponding data was recorded. 
The year is the year in which the corresponding data was recorded. 
The plot_id specifies the plot type that was used in constructing the data.
The species_id is a two-letter code that specifies the first letter of the genus and the first letter of the species of the organism being observed.
The sex specifies whether the organism being tested is either female or male.
The hindfoot_length is a measure of the organism's hindfoot length that is being observed.
The weight is a measure of the organism's weight that is being observed.
